One of the hardest things that I have ever had to do was collaborate with others.
As an solo developer for many years, one of the hardest parts is joining into a team
environment.

<!-- end-excerpt -->

I've worked with only a few groups over the years. Three of them at this time will remain
nameless for the purpose of this post and their protection. For all intended purposes
I will be naming the first company "C" and the second one "V" and the most recent two, 
we'll call "K" and "D".

Collaborating with companies at a corporate level is a different experience entirely.
When you work for a registered corporate entity it's very uniform. You won't have
an opinion and solo work is invalidated until you earn yourself a real position or
value within the company. 

Group projects outside of corporate level are varried in ways. Many try to emulate
a corporate feeling without actually having the skillset or knowledge and it shows.
I will never tell a group that I have corporate capabilities even with my experiences
in the IT field, Security field and as a CTO due to the fact that I know that unless
I have a team to help me where I need help as much as I can help them, there's no
point in trying to designate positions like that.

Working with C was very much a corporate level position. Like usual, I was asked to prove
my value and work when joining in. It was a long battle. I have nothing ill to really say
about the company as working for that company was a dream of mine for many years but
it was just not in the future to be working with them forever.

V was an absolute nightmare to work with. They appear as a corporate entity but it's internal
workings were a mess of unorganized people. Barely anyone has any idea of what was going on
and even one of the heads of the project I was signed onto left the team shortly after. 
This was also my first job being promoted to a CTO which I wish I wasn't for a team like this.

From the beginning there was bad vibes coming from working with K because the topic being worked
on was a big target because the niche group I was brought into. I was also immediately promoted
to the team CTO for my previous experiences. The job was simple but destructive. I had to create
a full project itself on my own for lack of other developers. The rest of the team handled every
section of a corporate entity except and field of technology.

The environment working with D could be the strangest of them all. The group makes an honest
effort to come off as a legitimate business and make a very good job doing so even being one of
the few independant groups I've worked with over the years. This group is a good group of people
if not sometimes emotionally influenced. During my time with them I noticed an ignored double
standard it feels like. On a few things it's more than noticable after even a day on the team.

Every environment is different to work with and some are good and some are bad. It's a strange
environment for any solo developer and if any solo developer out there reads this I want to pass
on something from my experience if you haven't done group work, don't be afraid of collaboration.
Collaboration is part of being a developer. If you read documentation your collaborating with that
project all the way to live-sharing your work with others.

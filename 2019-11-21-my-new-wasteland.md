Hello visitors. Welcome to my new wasteland of a "Blog". I will mostly be posting
personal updates, project updates and other things by tag.

<!-- end-excerpt -->

I think I will start off with a small introduction. Call me DreadJaw. I'm a software
engineer who is mostly a NodeJS engineer with a love for TypeScript. I am currently
a developer for the online game [Dergun Town](https://derguns.town/) that you can find
me occasionally on. (The 18+ Only Server).

Thank you for visiting my blog.
